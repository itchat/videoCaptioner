## Intro

This is an open-source project designed to make bilingual video content more accessible.

### Key Features:

1.	**Advanced Speech Recognition**: Uses MLX-optimized Parakeet `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2` model for high-accuracy multilingual subtitle generation with significantly improved precision and 2x faster performance compared to previous models.
2.	**Optimized Multithreaded Processing**: 
    - Thread-safe concurrent processing for multiple videos
    - HTTP session reuse for improved performance
3.	**Intelligent Translation Engine**:  
    - Choose between Google Translate or OpenAI (customizable model, defaults to gpt-4o) for subtitle translation
    - **Revolutionary Batch Translation**: Inspired by immersive translation techniques, optimized SRT subtitle batch processing reduces API calls from thousands to single digits, dramatically improving translation speed and reducing costs
    - **New Paragraph Separator Translation System**: Replaces fragile JSON-based translation with robust %% separator format, eliminating parsing errors and improving reliability
    - Smart batch sizing (1200 chars/4 entries max) optimized for translation quality
    - Exponential backoff retry strategy with error tolerance
4.	**Performance Optimizations**:
    - MLX framework acceleration for Apple Silicon
    - Parakeet model caching to avoid repeated loading
    - Thread-safe result collection with accurate progress tracking
    - **Enhanced Progress Monitoring**: Fine-grained progress bars with real-time status updates and precise percentage tracking across all processing stages
    - Robust error handling that doesn't interrupt the entire workflow
    - Streamlined codebase with redundant code removal and manual code review

### Purpose:

This project is designed to help international students better understand educational content by reducing language barriers.   
By providing bilingual subtitles, it ensures that students can follow along more effectively in their native language, enhancing learning and comprehension.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

conda create -n video python=3.13
conda activate video

# Install dependencies (includes MLX framework for Apple Silicon optimization)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
```sh
python src/main.py
```

## Compilation

```sh
bash main.sh
```
